[][][]what the heck is this?[][][]

connect tac toe is a merging together of 
-connect 4 (aka four in a row)
-tic tac toe (aka noughts and crosses (the superior name but it doesn't work for the title))
to create a game that may or may not work well. who knows!

it was developed as part of a university assignment to develop a simple game in processing/java.

[][][]what are the rules?[][][]

the game begins as a regular game of connect 4.
both players may drop circles from the top of the board, and if they connect 4 circles of their
own colour, they win.

however, players are also given the option to place tic tac toe pieces. these pieces are not
effected by gravity, and can be placed anywhere on the board so long as:
-the placement of the piece is not already taken by another piece (e.g. you can't place it
if there's already a circle or a tic tac toe piece where you're placing)
-the place you are placing in is equal to or lower than the height of the highest current
connect 4 piece (e.g. if there is a connect 4 piece on the third row, you can only place
a tic tac toe piece on the third, second or first rows)

a player may also win by connecting 3 tic tac toe pieces. they can place a tic tac toe piece
whenever they like, however upon placing a tic tac toe piece, their next turn must be a connect
4 piece. this limits the amount of tic tac toe pieces that can be placed.

when dropping a connect 4 piece, you may choose to drop through tic tac toe pieces, or land on
top of them. this means that tic tac toe pieces can lead to multiple vaild positions for dropping
connect 4 pieces in a single column. an exception to this rule is if there are, for instance, two
X's stacked vertically:

X   <- tic tac toe pieces
X

#   <- bottom of the playfield

you could land on top of the first X, but landing on the bottom X would place you inside another
piece, so it's not a valid move. in this case, you could therefore land either on top of the
pieces:

@
X
X

#

or through the pieces onto the bottom of the playfield:

X
X
@
#

additional balancing changes may need to be made later on, depending on how many games tie out.

[][][]alright, but how are you planning to code something like this?[][][]

the board itself will be stored as an array, that is then read and drawn every frame via processing.

this board will be searched every time a move is made for a win condition. this will be done by
checking the area surrounding the placed piece for identical pieces (i.e. if the placed piece is
a tic tac toe X, it will search the surrounding 8 tiles for another X piece), and if one is found,
repeating the search on that tile with a set direction to search through.

for this to happen, two loops will be used, to find the two "ends" of a chain.

the first loop tries to find the end of the chain. given a set of relational coordinates (e.g.
{-1, -1} for up-left or {1, 1} for down-right) it will search for a piece in that location.
if there is a piece there, it will search in the same relational coordinates from that piece.
this will eventually halt once either the edge of the playfield or a different piece is found.

once this happens, the second loop will kick in. it will inverse the relational coordinates
(e.g. {-1, 0} would turn into {1, 0}) and start working back along the chain, this time
incrementing a counter to work out how long the total chain is.

the fact that we check both up and down the chain means that even if a winning piece is placed
in the middle of a chain, this algorithm will catch it.

finding placable locations will be easy. simply put, if a position has a null value, and the
position below it has a non-null value, a connect 4 piece is able to be placed there, and if
a position has a null value at all, a tic tac toe piece is able to be placed there.
